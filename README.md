# 15 Minute Blog
#### Ruby on Rails Crash Course at The Iron Yard
This blogging app was created to show the ease of building a blog with Ruby on Rails. The principles used in building a blog can be applied to many other types of data storage and presenetation.

It was built during a Ruby on Rails crash course I taught at The Iron Yard.
